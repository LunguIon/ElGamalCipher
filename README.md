# ElGamal Encryption Project

## Overview

This project implements the ElGamal public-key cryptosystem for encryption and decryption. ElGamal is widely used for secure communication and is based on the mathematical properties of modular exponentiation.

## Features

- Key generation for ElGamal encryption.
- Encryption of plaintext using ElGamal.
- Decryption of ciphertext using ElGamal.

## Files

- **elgamal.c**: The main C source code file containing the ElGamal implementation.
- **plain.txt**: Input file containing the plaintext for encryption.
- **cipher1.txt, cipher2.txt**: Output files containing the ciphertext components.
- **result.txt**: Output file containing the decrypted result.
- **README.md**: Project documentation file.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repository from git:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LunguIon/ElGamalCipher.git
1. **Compile the Code:**
   ```bash
   gcc elgamal.c -o elgamal
   ./elgamal

## View results
- Encrypted components are stored in **cipher1.txt** and **cipher2**.txt.
- Decrypted result is stored in **result.txt**.
## Requirments
   - GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
